            <h3>Hey There,<br>Myself Parthiv M</h3>
            <p>A dedicated BCA student/web developer at Nirmala College, Muvattupuzha, with a passion for programming
                and technology.</p>
            <p>Currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Applications, I've always been fascinated by the endless
                possibilities that technology offers. From a young age, I've been drawn to the world of coding,
                intrigued by its power to solve problems and bring ideas to life.</p>
            <p>As I progress in my studies and career, my goal is to become a proficient software/web/full stack
                developer, contributing innovative solutions to real-world problems. I'm eager to explore new
                technologies, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and make a meaningful impact in the tech
                industry.</p>
